# Bob's Maximum Awesome

In here you'll find my personal revisions to maximum awesome.  I will attempt
to upstream as much as possible, but some things are personal preferences that
may not be applicable.

# Differences
- Linux support!
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
- Folding support (spacebar will toggle fold state)
- `.` Will retain column position so it can be repeated more easily.
- Many new mappings:
  - `H` and `L` (mapped to `^` and `$` respectively)
  - `,h` Clear all search highlighting

# Installation
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/rphan/maximum-awesome.git`
1. `$ cd maximum-awesome`
1. `rake`

# Updating

`git pull` should do the trick.

In the past, I was tracking upstream as `master` and maintaining my changes in a feature branch.
Since most of my pull requests are ignored, I'm not going to bother doing that anymore.

# Future plans

Just check out my open issues.

# Thanks!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to contribute to
my fork.
